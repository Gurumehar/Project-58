                <h2>About</h2>
        <p>The number of possible unique chess games is much greater than the number of electrons in the universe. The number of electrons is estimated to be about 10^79, while the number of unique chess games is 10^120. 2. The longest chess game theoretically possible is 5,949 moves.Chess is one of the most interesting sports because it never repeats itself, there are never two equal matches, and it never bores you. You can even play it online! ... Playing chess is fun and, if you win, it's even better!
            The notion that playing chess makes you smarter goes something like this: chess requires concentration and intelligence, and as mathematics and literacy require the same general skills, then practising chess must also improve one's academic achievement.So, how do you win a chess game if you don't say anything â€“ the simple answer is if your opponent's King has nowhere to move. The primary goal of a chess game is to trap your opponent's King. If the King can't move anymore, then the game is over. You don't need to say anything to win.I know all the rules of chess and I am a good player also . My nanaji are the champ of chess , he always beat me . But I also won one time when my two more cousins helped me.He and my mother taught me how to play.
